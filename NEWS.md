# bmm (development version)

### New features
* New **multivariate models** (experimental): several models can be estimated jointly to obtain the full correlation matrix of their subject-level parameters. Each model is wrapped in a **bmm_component()** together with its formula and data; components are combined with `+` and passed to `bmm()` as the formula argument. Plain distributional families such as `lognormal()` can be components too, so model parameters can be correlated with external covariates. Random effects that share an ID within `|ID|` bars across components (e.g. `(1 | p | id)`) are placed in a single correlation matrix spanning all components, which can be extracted with `brms::VarCorr()`; this estimates individual-difference correlations without the attenuation of two-step approaches (#394). Multivariate specifications support `stancode()`, `standata()`, `default_prior()`, `brms::log_lik(resp = )`, `parameters()`, `summary()` (one block per component) and `pp_check(resp = )`. `bmm` warns when no `|ID|` label is shared between components, when components tied by a shared label have no grouping values in common (their correlations are then not identified), and when a factor predictor has different levels across components; it reports the number of shared groups when the overlap is partial. Initial values are set for every parameter of the joint model: components whose model defines initialization ranges (e.g. `ddm`, `ezdm`, `cswald`) use them, and all remaining parameters are drawn as `brm(init = 1)` would draw them. Not yet supported: the `sdm` model, families requiring response addition terms (e.g. `binomial`), `update()`, `conditional_effects()` and `emmeans()`. A new article, *Estimating individual differences with multivariate models*, introduces the feature with a worked example and a comparison against two-step correlation of point estimates.
* The **sdm** model now supports within-chain parallelization via the `threads` argument (e.g. `bmm(..., threads = 2)`), reducing fitting time by up to ~45% in benchmarks (#374).
* Add `softplus` as an opt-in link function for positively-bounded parameters, as an alternative to the default `log` link. `softplus(x) = log(1 + exp(x))` keeps parameters positive while growing linearly for large values, avoiding the numerical blow-up of `exp()` and giving predictor effects an additive (rather than multiplicative) interpretation on the natural scale. Enable it per parameter via the model's `links` list, e.g. `m3(...)$links <- list(c = "softplus", a = "softplus")` or `ddm(rt, response, links = list(bound = "softplus"))` (#363).

### Bug fixes
* `combine_prior()` and `validate_default_priors()` no longer fail on empty priors and on formulas without parameter formulas, which arise for components of multivariate models that use a plain distributional family (#394).
* Fix initial values being set in two places, where the `init` returned by `configure_model()` was silently overwritten by `create_initfun()`. This caused the **m3** model's intended `init = 0` (needed for stable sampling with the `simple` choice rule and an `identity` link) to be lost, and left dead `init` code in the **sdm** model. `create_initfun()` is now the single source of truth for initial values, with model-specific behaviour expressed through S3 methods (#375).
* Fix `.pwald()` returning `NaN`/`-Inf` in the upper tail of the shifted-Wald survival function, which propagated to `dcswald()` (and therefore `log_lik`/`posterior_predict`) for the **cswald** model at extreme reaction times. The R-side survival now uses the stable `log_diff_exp` form already used by the Stan likelihood (`swald_lccdf`) (#376).
* Fix `print()` for model summaries selecting regression-coefficient rows by an unanchored substring match, so a parameter such as `a` could pull in rows of another parameter like `kappa` (e.g. in the **imm** model). Rows are now matched on the exact parameter prefix. This also fixes a crash when only a single coefficient row is shown (#379, #369).
* `create_initfun()` now matches Stan parameters to model parameters with a word-boundary regex (`(^|_)param(_|$)`) instead of a substring match, preventing collisions in models with short parameter names (e.g. `s`, `c`, `a`) that are substrings of longer ones (`sim`, `correct`, `activation`); the longest (most specific) match is selected when several apply (#354, #355).
* `create_initfun()` now resolves initialization terms from `nlpars` when a model parameter is not a distributional parameter, so models built as non-linear brms formulas (e.g. native-multinomial models whose parameters live in `bterms$nlpars`) no longer error with `no applicable method for 'has_intercept' applied to an object of class "NULL"` (#362).
* `bmm()` now warns when a predictor in the formula shares its name with both a predicted parameter and a column in the data. Such a predictor was silently treated as a non-linear term (emitted via `nlf()` instead of `lf()`), changing the likelihood without any error. Short parameter names (`c`, `a`, `s`, `b`) collide naturally with condition codes or columns like `accuracy`/`stimulus` (#378).

### Other changes
* Added an internal consistency check in `configure_prior()`: if a model's `fixed_parameters` includes a parameter that its `configure_model()` never wires into the formula (neither a dpar nor an nlpar), bmm now fails with a clear model-definition error instead of letting a malformed `b_Intercept ~ constant()` prior reach `brm()`. This is a safety net for model development; it cannot be reached through the normal `bmm()` interface, where an unrecognized parameter is already caught earlier by `check_formula()` (#377).
* `print.bmmodel()` now also displays the required response variables (one per line, annotated with the expected coding — e.g. radians in [-pi, pi] for the circular models, seconds and 0/1 responses for the trial-wise RT models) and the default parameter links, answering "what does my data frame need to look like?" directly at the console (#392).
* Recalibrated the default priors for the **m3** activation parameters (`a`, `c`) so that the `simple` and `softmax` choice rules imply a comparable, broad prior-predictive range of average performance, and so that the `softmax` defaults place equal prior means on general (`a`) and context (`c`) activation — centering the implied `c - a` prior at zero for fair comparisons under cell-means coding. The mis-scaled `normal(0, 2)` effect prior on `c` is replaced by the shared `normal(0, 0.5)`. Because the `simple` rule requires `c > a` to predict accurate recall, its defaults remain asymmetric; direct comparisons of context and general activation should use the `softmax` choice rule (#364).

### Developer-facing changes
* The steps that turn a specification into the arguments of `brm()` now live in one internal generic, `configure_fit()`, shared by `bmm()`, `stancode()`, `standata()` and `default_prior()`; the extractors no longer build the initial-values function, so they generate the Stan code once. The blocks of the printed summary are shared helpers reused by all summary methods (#394).
* **`use_model_template()` now scaffolds the current model-specification patterns.** It generates a flat `.{model}_defaults` block for unversioned models (like `ddm`) or, with the new `versions` argument, a `.{model}_version_table` block for versioned models (like `cswald`). The generated constructor spells out every field of the model object inline (referencing the defaults/version table for `parameters`, `links`, `fixed_parameters`, `default_priors`, and `init_ranges`), and versioned aliases validate `version` with `match.arg()` (#350).
* **Removed the unused `void_mu` field** from all model definitions and the template. It was assigned but never read anywhere — response-mean suppression is already handled via `fixed_parameters` and the family's `dpars` (#350).

# bmm 1.3.1

### Bug fixes
* Fix `swald_lccdf()` returning incorrect log-survival probability when response time equals non-decision time in the **cswald** model. Previously returned `-Inf` instead of `0` (log of survival = 1) (#348).

### Other changes
* The **ddm** model supports both `cmdstanr` and `rstan` backends. Previously, `cmdstanr` was required.

# bmm 1.3.0

### New models
* Add the **Diffusion Decision Model** (`ddm`) for speeded decision-making tasks with trial-level RT and response data. The model estimates drift rate, boundary separation, non-decision time, and (optionally) relative starting point. Includes distribution functions `dddm()` and `rddm()` (#280).
* Add the **EZ-Diffusion Model** (`ezdm`) for speeded decision-making tasks. The model estimates drift rate, boundary separation, and non-decision time from aggregated summary statistics (mean RT, variance of RT, accuracy) using the closed-form equations derived by Wagenmakers et al. (2007). Supports both 3-parameter (symmetric starting point) and 4-parameter (asymmetric starting point) versions based on Srivastava et al. (2016). Implements Bayesian hierarchical estimation following Chavez & Vandekerckhove (2025). Includes distribution functions `dezdm()` and `rezdm()` (#281).
* Add the **Censored Shifted Wald Model** (`cswald`) for choice reaction time tasks with two response boundaries. The model estimates drift rate, boundary separation, and non-decision time from trial-level RT and response data. Implements two versions: **simple** (treats errors as censored correct responses, appropriate for high-accuracy tasks) and **crisk** (competing risks version with separate accumulators for each response, suitable for balanced accuracy). Includes distribution functions `dcswald()`, `pcswald()`, `qcswald()`, and `rcswald()`. Thanks to @GidonFrischkorn

### New features
* New S3 method **conditional_effects()** for `bmmfit` objects. Provides an intuitive interface for visualizing predictor effects on model parameters, with automatic routing between distributional and non-linear parameters, inverse link transformations to show parameters on their natural scale (`scale = "native"`), softmax handling for mixture3p weight parameters, and filtering of internal model variables (#203).
* New S3 methods for **emmeans** support on `bmmfit` objects. Users can now call `emmeans(fit, ~ condition, dpar = "kappa")` for any bmmodel (#323).
* New **pp_check()** method for multinomial models (e.g., `m3`). Since `brms::pp_check()` does not support the multinomial family, `bmm` now provides a custom method that compares observed and predicted response proportions in the `ppc_bars` style from `bayesplot`. The method supports faceting by experimental conditions via `group`, configurable credible intervals via `probs`, and population-level predictions via `re_formula = NA`. For non-multinomial models, `pp_check()` delegates to `brms::pp_check()` and auto-selects the grouped plot variant when `group` is specified (#324).
* New function **parameters()** lists all parameters of a `bmmodel` or `bmmfit` object with descriptions, link functions, and fixed values (#329).
* New function **extract_stan_blocks()** extracts individual program blocks (functions, data, parameters, etc.) from compiled Stan code (#286).
* New function **extract_parameter_dimensions()** extracts parameter names, dimensions, and types from a Stan parameters block.
* New functions **ezdm_summary_stats()** and **adjust_ezdm_accuracy()** to compute and pre-process summary statistics from trial-level RT data for the EZ-Diffusion Model (#291).
* New functions **flag_contaminant_rts()** and **validate_fast_guesses()** for trial-level contamination detection in RT data. Identifies fast guesses and attention lapses using mixture modeling and provides Bayesian validation of fast guess assumptions (#307).
* New function **create_initfun()** creates initialization functions for models that benefit from or require initial values for MCMC sampling (#285).

### Deprecated functions and arguments
* BREAKING CHANGE: remove **get_model_prior(), get_stancode() and get_standata()**. Due to [recent changes](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms/pull/1604) in *brms* version 2.21.0, you can now use the *brms* functions **default_prior**, **stancode** and **standata** directly with *bmm* models.
* the function **fit_model()** is deprecated in favor of **bmm()** and will be removed in a future version (#163)
* the argument **setsize** for the **mixture3p** and **IMM** models is now called **set_size** for consistency. The old argument name is deprecated and will be removed in a future version (#163)
* the distributions functions for the imm model are renamed from **dIMM**, **pIMM**, **rIMM** and **qIMM** to **dimm**, **pimm**, **rimm** and **qimm** (#163)

* the **sdmSimple()** model is now called **sdm()**. The old name is deprecated and will be removed in a future version (#163)

### Other changes
* **bmm** now requires the at least version 2.21.0 of **brms**.

# bmm 0.4.0

### New features

* add a check for the **sdmSimple** model if the data is sorted by predictors. This leads to much faster sampling. The user can control the default behavior with the **sort_data** argument (#72)
* the **mixture3p** and **IMM** models now require that the intercept must be suppressed when set size is used as a predictor (#96).
* add postprocessing methods for **sdmSimple** to allow the use of **pp_check()**, **conditional_effects** and **bridgesampling** with the model (#30)
* add informed default priors for all models. You can always use the **get_model_prior()** function to see the default priors for a model
* add a new function **set_default_prior** for developers, which allows them to more easily set default priors on new models regardless of the user-specified formula
* you can now specify variables for models via regular expressions rather than character vectors (#102)
* you can now view and set all **bmm** global options via **bmm_options()**. See **?bmm_options** for more information
* add a start-up message upon loading the package 

### Bug fixes
* fix a bug in the **mixture3p** and **IMM** models which caused an error when intercept was not suppressed and set size was used as predictor
* **update()** now works properly with **bmmfit** objects (#95)
* fix a bug in the **sort_data** check which caused an error when using grouped covariance structure in random effects across different parameters

### Other changes
* **brms** is now loaded automatically when loading **bmm** with **library(bmm)**

# bmm 0.3.0

### New features

* BREAKING CHANGE: The **fit_model** function now requires a **bmmformula** to be passed. The syntax of the **bmmformula** or its short form **bmf** is equal to specifying a **brmsformula**. However, as of this version the **bmmformula** only specifies how parameters of a **bmmodel** change across experimental conditions or continuous predictors. The response variables that the model is fit to now have to be specified when the model is defined using **model = bmmodel()**. (#79)
* BREAKING CHANGE: The **non_target** and **spaPos** variables for the **mixture3p** and **IMM** models were relabeled to **nt_features** and **nt_distances** for consistency. This is also to communicate that distance is not limited to spatial distance but distances on any feature dimensions of the retrieval cues. Currently, still only a single generalization gradient for the cue features is possible. 
* This release includes reference fits for all implemented models to ensure that future changes to the package do not compromise the included models and change the results that their implementations produce.
* The **check_formula** methods have been adapted to match the new **bmmformula** syntax. It now evaluates if formulas have been specified using the **bmmformula** function, if formulas for all parameters of a **bmmodel** have been specified and warns the user that only a fixed intercept will be estimated if no formula for one of the parameters was provided. Additionally, **check_formula** throws an error should formulas be provided that do not match a parameter of the called **bmmodel** unless they are part of a non-linear transformation.
* You can now specify formulas for internally fixed parameters such as **mu** in all visual working memory models. This allows you to predict if there is response bias in the data. If a formula is not provided for **mu**, the model will assume that the mean of the response distribution is fixed to zero.
* there is now an option **bmm.silent** that allows to suppress messages
* the baseline activation **b** was removed from the **IMM** models, as this is internally fixed 
to zero for scaling and as of now cannot be predicted by independent variables because the model would be unidentifiable.
* the arguments used to fit the **bmmodel** are now accessible in the **bmmfit** object via the `fit$bmm$fit_args` list.
* add class('bmmfit') to the object returned from fit_model() allowing for more flexible postprocessing of the underlying **brmsfit** object. The object is now of class('bmmfit', 'brmsfit')
* changes to column names of datasets **zhang_luck_2008** and **oberauer_lin_2017** to make them more consistent

### Bug Fixes
* an error with the treatment of distances in the **IMMfull** and the **IMMbsc** has been corrected. This versions ensures that only positive distances can be passed to any of the two models.
* removed a warning regarding the scaling of the distances in the **IMMfull** and the **IMMbsc** that was specific only for circular distances.

### Documentation
* All articles have been update to the new **bmmformula** syntax.

### New features

* BREAKING CHANGE: Improve user interface to fit_model() ensures package stability and future development. Model specific arguments are now passed to the model functions as named arguments (e.g. **mixture3p(non_targets, setsize)**).
