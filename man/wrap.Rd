\title{Wrap angles that extend beyond (-pi;pi)}
\usage{
wrap(x, radians = TRUE, scale = 360)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector, matrix or data.frame of values to be wrapped. In
radians (default), degrees, or the scale of the circumference of the circular space.}

\item{radians}{Logical. Is x in radians (default=TRUE) or not (FALSE)}

\item{scale}{numeric. The scale of the circular space, if the input is not in radians.
The default is 360 as for degrees, but any scale for the circumference of the circular
space can be specified. For example, 180 degrees for bar orientations without a direction.}
}
\value{
An object of the same type as x
}
\description{
On the circular space, the distances between two values can be only in the range (-pi;pi
or -180;180). When subtracting two values in the circular space, this can result in values outside of
this range. For example, when calculating the difference between a value of
10 degrees minus 340 degrees, this results in a difference of 330 degrees.
However, the true difference between these two values is -30 degrees. This
function wraps such values, so that they represent the appropriate distance on the circular space.

\examples{
x <- runif(1000, -pi, pi)
y <- runif(1000, -pi, pi)
diff <- x - y
hist(diff)
wrapped_diff <- wrap(x - y)
hist(wrapped_diff)
