\usage{
sdt(response, stimulus, nTrials = NULL, dist_noise = "normal", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{response}{The variable name of the response variable in the data set.
The response given when a stimulus appears. Either these can be integers
indicating that noise/new information was detected \code{0} or a signal/old information was
detected \code{1}. Or the sum of responses for signal/old information, when data is aggregated}

\item{stimulus}{The variable name of the stimulus variable in the data set.
The type of stimulus that was presented. Either an integer value indicating
noise/new stimuli with \code{0} and signal/old stimuli with \code{1}, or a factor variable using
dummy coding with noise/new stimulus factors as the baseline level. If a factor variable
is used this factor should only have two levels: one for noise/new stimuli and another
for signal/old stimuli}

\item{nTrials}{The variable name of the variable specifying the number of trials in the data set.
This argument only needs to be specified if aggregated data is provided in the response variable.}

\item{dist_noise}{The noise distribution that should be assumed for the Signal Detection model.
Currently, the following noise distributions are supported: "normal", "gumbel",
"cauchy", and "logistic". The default is to assume normal noise around both the
signal and noise distribution in the SDT model.}

\item{...}{used internally for testing, ignore it}

}
\item \strong{Requirements:}
\itemize{
\item provide the number of signal or old responses for the different stimulus types presented (signal/noise or old/new)
\item provide the stimulus type either signal/noise or old/new, this can be a factor with dummy coding with 0 = noise/new, and 1 = signal/old, or a numeric vector with equal coding
\item provide the number of total trial for each stimulus type in each condition
\item additionally, you can select different noise distributions for the Signal Decetion Theory model. For details please see the provided reference.
}
\item \strong{Parameters:}
\itemize{
\item \code{dprime}: The level of signal from a perceptual or memory stimulus to be recognized
\item \code{crit}: The criterion of activation to be reached for a stimulus to be recognized. This is parmaeterized as the bias relative to the optimal criterion at dprime/2
