\title{Generic S3 method for configuring the default prior for a bmmmodel}
\usage{
configure_prior(model, data, formula, user_prior, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A \code{bmmmodel} object}

\item{data}{A data.frame containing the data used in the model}

\item{formula}{A \code{brmsformula} object returned from configure_model()}

\item{user_prior}{A \code{brmsprior} object given by the user as an argument to
fit_model()}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the method}
}
\description{
Called by fit_model() to automatically construct the priors for a given
model, data and formula, and combine it with the prior given by the user. The
first method executed is configure_prior.bmmmodel, which will build the prior
based on information from the model object such as fixed_parameters,
default_priors, etc. Thus it is important to define these values in the model
object. The function will also recognize if the user has specified that some
parameters should be fixed to a constant and put the appropriate constant
priors. Any additional priors that a developer wants to specify, which are
not based on information in the model object, can be defined in the
configure_prior.* method for the model. See configure_prior.IMMfull for an
example.
